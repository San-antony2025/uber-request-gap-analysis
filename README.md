# 🚕 Uber Request Gap Analysis

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project to identify gaps between ride demand and driver supply on the Uber platform using timestamped request data.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Uber experiences a large volume of ride requests, but many go unfulfilled due to cancellations or driver unavailability. This project analyzes request patterns to uncover causes of unfulfilled rides and suggests data-driven solutions.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

- Improve ride fulfillment rates
- Optimize driver allocation by location and time
- Enhance customer satisfaction
- Maximize revenue by reducing service failures
- Support real-time, data-backed decisions

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Google Colab** (Python 3)
- **Excel** (initial data cleaning)
- **SQL** (SQLite3 via Python)
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **GitHub** (for project hosting)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- High **"No Cars Available"** at Airport during evening
- High **"Cancelled"** status in City during morning
- Requests peak during **5–9 AM** and **5–9 PM**
- Fulfilled rides don't match rising demand – a clear supply-demand mismatch

---

## 📈 Visualizations

Includes 12+ chart types:
- Bar, Pie, Donut, Histogram, Box
- Grouped Bar, Violin, Countplot
- Heatmap, Line Chart, Area Chart, Facet Grid

All charts are saved under `/charts` with detailed captions.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Incentivize drivers during peak slots
- Reallocate supply to match geographic and temporal demand
- Use predictive modeling to anticipate service gaps
- Add location-based bonus programs

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

By identifying ride request gaps through EDA, Uber can improve service reliability, reduce cancellations, and boost operational efficiency — creating a better experience for both riders and drivers.
