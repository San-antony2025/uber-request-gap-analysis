        "This project focused on analysing the imbalance between ride requests and driver availability in Uber’s platform, using a real-world dataset of ride requests. The core objective was to identify when and where the demand for rides surpassed the available supply of drivers, leading to service gaps such as cancellations or instances where no cars were available. The ultimate goal was to generate insights that could support smarter driver allocation and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, the dataset—comprised of individual ride requests—underwent thorough preprocessing using Excel, Python (Pandas and NumPy), and SQL. This phase involved cleaning missing or incomplete entries, resolving inconsistencies in timestamps, and standardizing categorical variables. Special attention was paid to aligning time-related data, as the timing of ride requests played a pivotal role in identifying demand patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the data was cleaned, exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate key performance indicators. These included the total number of requests, trip statuses (such as “Completed,” “Cancelled,” or “No Cars Available”), and the relationship between request outcomes and factors like pickup point and time of day. The team introduced a time slot categorization scheme—dividing the day into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night—to segment the data and make temporal trends more visible.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Using pivot tables and grouped analysis, several striking patterns emerged. One of the most significant findings centered around the Airport pickup point. During early morning and evening rush hours, the volume of ride requests peaked sharply—yet driver availability did not scale with this increase in demand. As a result, a large proportion of requests either went unfulfilled due to a lack of nearby drivers or were outright cancelled. This mismatch suggested a critical service bottleneck during specific time windows and locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the analysis indicated that this supply-demand gap was not evenly distributed across the day or across pickup zones. While urban areas occasionally experienced similar issues, the discrepancy was far more pronounced at the Airport, which faced persistent shortages despite its high request volume. This pointed to a need for more dynamic and data-responsive driver deployment models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the insights gathered, several recommendations were proposed. These included implementing a dynamic scheduling system for drivers, particularly one that adjusts driver allocation based on predicted demand in specific time slots and regions. Additionally, incentivizing drivers to operate in high-demand but under-served areas—like the Airport during peak hours—could help balance the system more effectively. Another suggestion involved leveraging real-time data to alert nearby drivers of surging demand, allowing for a quicker response to high-volume request periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the project provided a clear illustration of how operational inefficiencies—driven by a misalignment of supply and demand—can negatively impact ride-sharing services. By combining data cleaning, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition, the study not only diagnosed the core issues but also proposed tangible solutions to improve Uber’s responsiveness and efficiency. These findings underscore the importance of proactive, data-informed decision-making in service-oriented platforms, particularly those operating in fast-paced, demand-driven environments.\n",
